# JBitTorrent

This repository is a modified copy of the JBitTorrent project from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbittorrent/).



---
There are three changes, added to the original project:
 
1. The build tool system migrated from Eclipse to Maven.
2. Fixed bug with opened stream (it made impossible to move\delete it), after generating torrent-file
3. Configured jar file (with dependencies) to build the project into .jar.
