# JBitTorrent

This repository is a modified copy of the JBitTorrent project from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbittorrent/).



---
There are three changes, added to the original project:
 
1. The build tool system migrated from Eclipse to Maven.
2. Fixed bug with opened stream (it makes impossible to move\delete torrent files, after their generation).
3. Configured jar file (with dependencies) to build the project into .jar.
